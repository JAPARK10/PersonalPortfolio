                                In the financial world various machine learning techniques are applied to different
                                tasks. They are used to manage risk and predict price movements for every kind of
                                asset. Forecasting accuracy as well as especiency thereby play a major role. Therefore
                                in this thesis we wanted to evaluate the performance of three machine learning
                                algorithms that were trained on stocks and ETFs with different volatility. This
                                thesis compares their performance and investigates what impact the volatility in
                                the training data has. The models we used are vanilla LSTM, CNN and XGBoost.
                                A variety of technical and macro-economic indicators were added as features. The
                                XGBoost model performed outstandingly. With approximately one hour execution
                                time it was 32 times faster than the LSTM and about 4.5 times faster than the CNN
                                model while having the best overall error. The LSTM is close behind the XGBoost
                                in terms of predictive accuracy and the CNN has a much higher error. The thesis
                                was aimed to show relations of predictive accuracy and certain characteristics in the
                                data while focusing on the volatility as a characteristic. This can help to clarify
                                strengths and weaknesses of certain models when applied to more or less volatile
                                assets. Some further research questions are suggested in the end.

                    As a group of 5 we developed a full stack web application. As the DevOps responsible I
                    created and maintained a CI/CD pipeline as well as a coherent docker infrastructure. Furthermore
                    I was responsible for the deployment of the application to a Virtual Machine on the university server.
                    The application is a web application that allows students to send application forms to the faculty about
                    recognising modules from other universities.

                    Everyone who wants to make music needs a good rhythm. Some have it in their blood, others need a little help.
                    I designed and implemented a visual and acoustical metronome that helps you to keep the rhythm.
                    I added the visual flashlight feature for people who are deaf and cant hear or also for people
                    who like to make recordings and dont want any sound on the recording.

                    Having a counter side to heavy mental work is important to me.
                    I love to do sports, especially Kite surfing, Snowboarding, Hiking and working out.
                    I have tried so many different sports, for example, badminton, spike ball, Kick-Boxing, chess, football,
                    basketball, volleyball, table tennis and a whole lot more. 
                    The most intense discipline I have ever tried was having siblings.
                    Seriously: Pushing myself to a constantly rising bar is my main axiom.

                    It all started when my father's aunt moved to america, married and started investing in the stock market.
                    She sent my father letters where she told him how her life was like and what she did. 
                    At that time there was no public opportunity to nvest in the stock market in germany.
                    Right after germanys reunification, my father started investing in the stock market.
                    He taught me a lot about the stock market and how to invest.
                    Through that I developed a passion for the stock market, its benefits and its dynamics.
                    End of story!

                    I approach the problem with a logical mindset and creativity, which allows me to find the root causes and most efficient and suitable solutions. I deepened this skill during various university projects and my work experience. The fact that identifying and analyzing problems is as fun to me as I’m good at it, is evidenced by my behavior in general. When it comes to games and riddles, I quickly find a sophisticated and efficient strategy to tackle the problem. Besides that, in situations where you go from A to B in the city and you for example have to pass by location C, D and E I would quickly figure out the overall shortest route to visit each location.

                    Adapting to new environments and surroundings is one of my strengths. During my work experience, I had an accelerating and fast start. getting used to new technologies and interfaces is always a quick thing for me and also the Erasmus stay shows, that I’m capable of quickly adapting to a new environment and tackle other challenges without much effort.

                    As someone who has a strong plan for the own life and a vision of the own future, I learned to effectively plan ahead and schedule my tasks. I divide my time for different parts of my life to have a productive work environment. For me this leads to getting things done on time and maintaining a good work-life balance. I state that the greatest benefit of a good work-life balance is that in the time when you work you get in a state of 100% flow, where you focus on the task without any distraction.

                    If you come together with people every challenge becomes solvable. In this sentence, there are two important statements. First; to get together with people and second; to solve challenges. The first one was always a pleasure to me as I’m a communicative and outgoing person, as well as of a well behaved and respectful nature. The second statement talks about problem solving. As a group, the most important skill is to divide tasks and responsibilities in a way that allows you to trust each other’s competences and skills.
