                    I'm currently writing my bachelor's thesis.
                    The project consists of doing research about how AI can be used in trading.
                    The second step of the project is to research which model architecture would best
                    suit the purpose of predicting stock price changes. The third step is to implement
                    such a model, train it on historical data and verify the predicitons. A comprehensive analysis
                    and processing of the results will represent the conclusion of my work.
                    
                    technologies I plan to use: Github, VSCode, Alpaca API, python (numpy, pandas, alpaca-trade-api, sklearn,

                    I was the DevOps engineer.
                    We were a team of 7 and we divided the responsibilities evenly during our first meeting.
                    Our task was to build a website for the department of mathematics and computer science.
                    This website is designed for students who passed modules at other universities
                    and want to have them credited towards their studies.
                    
                    My first task was to build the gitlab pipeline for a continuos integration and a continuos
                    deployment. Our website should always be deployed to a virtual machine on the university
                    servers. I maintained the pipeline through the whole development process which led to adding
                    a couple of things later on like unit tests. Furthermore I was responsible to create the
                    docker images which we would use. We used 3 container, one for the frontend, one for the
                    backend and one for the database. Furthermore I added docker compose to the project to keep
                    the containers orchestrated properly. Later in the process I joined the frontend team and
                    took on tasks like adding buttons that provide different languages for the whole Web Application or
                    graphical design of modules.
                    
                    This project was a lot of fun and one of the more extensive endeavors. Besides technological things,
                    a big learning for me was, to use the benefit of properly planing my work and especially the workload.
                    What happened was that, after I had a lot of initial work setting up the pipeline, environment variables
                    and docker containers, I felt a bit underwhelmed after that. That's why I joined the frontend team,
                    which was a more spontanous initiative on my part. If I had known about the workload distribution of
                    a DevOps engineer, I would have been able to plan ahead and already have tasks for when the initial work is done.

                <span class="description">
                    During my studies I had the chance to experience the job as a software engineer.
                    I was a working student for a great company who is part of a global group - the Rohde & Schwarz group.
                    From day one I had a mentor guiding me and helping me whenever I needed advice.
                    It was a very convenient first working experience for me to make. It gave me the opportunity
                    to learn a lot about technologies and bigger scale software projects, Office atmosphere and communication,
                    and self directed working. I worked on different projects, all about analyzing data traffic using
                    advanced algorithms and creative approaches. I signed a NDA so I cant go further in detail here.

                <span class="description">
                    This Weekend was one of those with little sleep and a lot of brainpower.
                    The Hackathon began on Friday afternoon with a little welcoming and detailed briefing.
                    We then were divided into groups of three and tasked with coming up with a solution
                    to help the company prevent man-in-the-middle attacks when receiving and paying invoices
                    from their service providers. Our solution was to create a verified list of service providers
                    with their bank details. So only when a service provider sends an invoice for the first time
                    or when the service providers bank details change an extended verification of the new details
                    using google authenticator is required. Having a well-designed and working solution implemented
                    by the end of the weekend, earned our group a decent reward and a job offer.

                    In high school I was a member of the "Zuseum society".
                    It is a society around Konrad Zuse - the creator of the first fully functional computer.
                    The society has a lot of tools and devices to build, invent and craft things.
                    We did a lot of things like over and over again maintaining an old model railway,
                    printing 3D objects like chess figures and building a LED ping pong detection.
                    In one of the biggest projects we undertook, we built a robot with wheels, a motor,
                    a battery and a super sonic sensor. We later wrote code for the robot in
                    Arduino (based on C/C++) so that it keeps driving and just stops when
                    an obstacle is near.

                <span class="description">
                    Besides many much smaller projects I programmed 2 bigger games. 
                    One was a 2D dungeon role play game. It had beautiful graphics, which I designed and painted myself
                    and it had sound effects, collectibles and enemies. You could also create a save state for taking a break
                    and continuing at the same state later. <br>
                    The other game was a typical space invader. Here I also designed and painted the graphics myself
                    and I had a lot of fun with immersing myself into the logic of the game and facing all the little
                    obstacles that come up with such a project, eventually overcoming them.

                    During high school we had first contact with cyber security principles like encryption and secure channels.
                    In our free time a friend of mine and I established a secure communication channel between us
                    using public key encryption and experimenting with other ways of encryption. This was very interesting
                    and gave me first hands on experience in the area of cyber security which I would deepen later in my studies.

                    That's why sport has been a part of my life since it started. I was playing a lot of
                    table tennis at a young age. I played it every school break in primary school and I was
                    in a club for 8 years during high school. When I was able to stand I learned to ski.
                    Since then, being on the slopes has become an annual highlight. Later, I transitioned
                    to snowboarding, which I enjoyed even more.
                    During my time in college, I participated in various kinds of sports. I did Kick Boxing
                    for more than one year. I tried Badminton, water polo, break dance and
                    I was in a climbing club for 2 years.

When it comes to games and riddles, I quickly find a sophisticated and efficient strategy to tackle the problem. Besides that, in situations where you go from A to B in the city and you for example have to pass by location C, D and E I would quickly figure out the overall shortest route to visit each location.

                    As someone who has a strong plan for the own life and a vision of the own future, I learned to effectively plan ahead and schedule my tasks. I divide my time for different parts of my life to have a productive work environment. For me this leads to getting things done on time and maintaining a good work-life balance. I state that the greatest benefit of a good work-life balance is that in the time when you work you get in a state of 100% flow, where you focus on the task without any distraction.

                    If you come together with people every challenge becomes solvable. In this sentence, there are two important statements. First; to get together with people and second; to solve challenges. The first one was always a pleasure to me as I’m a communicative and outgoing person, as well as of a well behaved and respectful nature. The second statement talks about problem solving. As a group, the most important skill is to divide tasks and responsibilities in a way that allows you to trust each other’s competences and skills.
