                    For one exciting weekend I participated in a hackathon organized by Minship.
                    The goal was to design and implement a solution for online identification.
                    We implemented a web application that invoked the Google authenticator.

                    Coming from my childhood passion for video games, I started to design and implement games.
                    I really enjoyed geting into the logic behind simple games like snake, tetris and space invader.
                    I also implemented one more complex 2D jump and run game.

                    I love to make music... since 18 years. I started playing the piano at the age of 5. 
                    I kept learning new techniques, instruments like the ukulele, the trombone and the violin.
                    Soon I will upload own composed music.

                    I also like to play Spike Ball or Badminton with friends. Pushing myself to a regularly rising bar is important to me.

                    I approach the problem with a logical mindset and creativity, which allows me to find the root causes and most efficient and suitable solutions. I deepened this skill during various university projects and my work experience. The fact that identifying and analyzing problems is as fun to me as I’m good at it, is evidenced by my behavior in general. When it comes to games and riddles, I quickly find a sophisticated and efficient strategy to tackle the problem. Besides that, in situations where you go from A to B in the city and you for example have to pass by location C, D and E I would quickly figure out the overall shortest route to visit each location.

                    Adapting to new environments and surroundings is one of my strengths. During my work experience, I had an accelerating and fast start. getting used to new technologies and interfaces is always a quick thing for me and also the Erasmus stay shows, that I’m capable of quickly adapting to a new environment and tackle other challenges without much effort.

                    As someone who has a strong plan for the own life and a vision of the own future, I learned to effectively plan ahead and schedule my tasks. I divide my time for different parts of my life to have a productive work environment. For me this leads to getting things done on time and maintaining a good work-life balance. I state that the greatest benefit of a good work-life balance is that in the time when you work you get in a state of 100% flow, where you focus on the task without any distraction.

                    If you come together with people every challenge becomes solvable. In this sentence, there are two important statements. First; to get together with people and second; to solve challenges. The first one was always a pleasure to me as I’m a communicative and outgoing person, as well as of a well behaved and respectful nature. The second statement talks about problem solving. As a group, the most important skill is to divide tasks and responsibilities in a way that allows you to trust each other’s competences and skills.
