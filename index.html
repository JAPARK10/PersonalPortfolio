                    backend and database and the orchestration of those. Our client was a university that

                    I solved a lot of different problems around network protocols and communication. 
                    I was working a lot with wireshark and tcpdump to analyze network packets and their content.
                    The main protocols that we were looking into were TCP/IP and UDP besides some others.
                    I enjoyed great work with colleagues and a healthy enviroment.

                    This Weekend was one of those with little sleep and a lot of brainpower.
                    The Hackathon began on Friday afternoon with a little welcoming and detailed briefing.
                    We then were divided into groups of three and tasked with coming up with a solution
                    to help the company prevent man-in-the-middle attacks when receiving and paying invoices
                    from their service providers. Our solution was to create a verified list of service providers
                    with their bank details. So only when a service provider sends an invoice for the first time
                    or when the service providers bank details change an extended verification of the new details
                    using google authenticator is required. Having a well-designed and working solution implemented
                    by the end of the weekend, earned our group a decent reward and a job offer.

                    In high school I was a member of the "Zuseum society".
                    It is a society around Konrad Zuse - the creator of the first fully functional computer.
                    The society has a lot of tools and devices to build, invent and craft things.
                    We did a lot of things like over and over again maintaining an old model railway,
                    printing 3D objects like chess figures and building a LED ping pong detection.
                    In one of the biggest projects we undertook, we built a robot with wheels, a motor,
                    a battery and a super sonic sensor. We later wrote code for the robot in
                    Arduino (based on C/C++) so that it keeps driving and just stops when
                    an obstacle is near.

                    Besides many much smaller projects I programmed 2 bigger games. 
                    One was a 2D dungeon role play game. It had beautiful graphics, which I designed and painted myself
                    and it had sound effects, collectibles and enemies. You could also create a save state for taking a break
                    and continuing at the same state later. <br>
                    The other game was a typical space invader. Here I also designed and painted the graphics myself
                    and I had a lot of fun with immersing myself into the logic of the game and facing all the little
                    obstacles that come up with such a project, eventually overcoming them.

                    During high school we had first contact with cyber security principles like encryption and secure channels.
                    In our free time a fellow student and I established a secure communication channel between us
                    using public key encryption and experimenting with other ways of encryption. This was very interesting
                    and gave me first hands on experience in the area of cyber security which I deepened later in my studies.

                    Now I improve my skills and knowledge on my own using Information I got during my classes.

                    That's why sport has been a part of my life since it started. I was playing a lot of
                    table tennis at a young age. I played it every school break in primary school and I was
                    in a club for 8 years during high school. When I was able to stand I learned to ski.
                    Since then, being on the slopes has become an annual highlight. Later, I transitioned
                    to snowboarding, which I enjoyed even more.
                    During my time in college, I participated in various kinds of sports. I did Kick Boxing
                    for more than one year. I tried Badminton, water polo, break dance and
                    I was in a climbing club for 2 years.

                    I approach the problem with a logical mindset and creativity, which allows me to find the root causes and most efficient and suitable solutions. I deepened this skill during various university projects and my work experience. The fact that identifying and analyzing problems is as fun to me as I’m good at it, is evidenced by my behavior in general. When it comes to games and riddles, I quickly find a sophisticated and efficient strategy to tackle the problem. Besides that, in situations where you go from A to B in the city and you for example have to pass by location C, D and E I would quickly figure out the overall shortest route to visit each location.

                    As someone who has a strong plan for the own life and a vision of the own future, I learned to effectively plan ahead and schedule my tasks. I divide my time for different parts of my life to have a productive work environment. For me this leads to getting things done on time and maintaining a good work-life balance. I state that the greatest benefit of a good work-life balance is that in the time when you work you get in a state of 100% flow, where you focus on the task without any distraction.

First; to get together with people and second; to solve challenges.
